# False Multiple Table    ![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)

In this program, We created a multiplication table which returns a false value for one place and detected that fraud multiplication table using python. Here I compared the original table with the fraud or wrong table and find the index that is wrong and give the correct output for it.

you may notice this file contains a scenario. The reason for that is just to develop your interest in the problems
 So, let me give a brief introduction of the scenario here. ;)
## Scenario
Someone wrote a python function to print a multiplication table of a given number and put one of the values (randomly generated) as wrong.
He did this to fool his classmates and make them commit a mistake in a test. You cannot tolerate this!

So you decided to use your python skills to counter his wrong actions by writing a python program that validates his multiplication table.

Your function should be able to find out the wrong values in the table and expose him .

**Note:** function returns a list of numbers like this
```
Function Input:
Multiplier(6)

Wrong table function returns this output:
[6, 12, 18, 26, â€¦., 60]

```
You have to write a correct function and return the index where table is wrong and print it to the screen! If the table is correct, your function returns None

### Module used
python module random `import random`

## PRE-REQUISITES
Your laptop with 3.6.x (onwards) installed.

**NOTE:** Those with Linux and MacOSX would have Python installed by default, no action required.

Windows: Download the version for your laptop via https://www.python.org/downloads/

**NOTES**
In your preferred editor, make sure indentation is set to "4 spaces".


## Run using Python3.8+
1. Clone or download repositiory: https://github.com/arevish/falsetable-generator.git
2. In source folder, run `python3 'fakemultitable.py'` to start program, optionally, run with `--help` argument to see other runtime options.
